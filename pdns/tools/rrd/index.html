<h1>PowerDNS Recursor Performance Graphs</H1>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Questions</td><td>End-user initiated DNS questions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Out-queries</td><td>Recursor initiated questions to other
nameservers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Throttled</td><td>If a certain nameserver is not responding, or if
it is, but returning unuseful answers, it is not useful to keep repeating
identical queries. If PowerDNS prevents a duplicate query, and therefore
prevents needless server load and delays, this is called a 'throttled
out-query'</td></tr>
<tr><td>Outgoing timeout</td><td>An out-query that did not generate an
answer within 1 or 2 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Noerror answer</td><td>A Question that was answered without an error
status</td></tr>
<tr><td>NXDOMAIN answer</td><td>A Question that was answered with a positive
indication that there is no answer</td></tr>
<tr><td>SERVFAIL answer</td><td>No answer could be given because the nameservers
carrying the answer did not respond, or were throttled</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cache hits/misses</td><td>A query is judged a cache-hit if it could
be answered without generating any out-queries</td></tr>
<tr><td>User/System CPU usage</td><td>Actual amount of CPU used exclusively
by the recursor, either in user or in system (kernel) mode</td></td>
