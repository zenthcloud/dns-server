The authoritative packet cache does not check whether a cached packet and the
response is it being matched again, have the same EDNS status (present vs.
not-present).

Because it does take max reply length into account, the impact of this is
limited - non-EDNS clients would only get EDNS replies from the cache if the
EDNS bufsize happened to be 512.
